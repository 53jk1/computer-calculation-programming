## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Basic computer calculations are implemented in the project. Everything is written in Python version 3.7+. Parameters are changed directly in the program code. I also put in the raw code here, without any binaries, so unfortunately you have to get Python on your computer and the numpy library which I used mainly for the project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

UNIX system especially
```
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
python3-pip install numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

#### Input
```
$ python3 01.py
```
#### Example Output
```
7.0
```

#### Input
```
$ python3 02.py
```

#### Example Output
```
4.000000000000001
41.302691944111686
The matrix is well coditioned.
```

#### Input
```
$ python3 03.py
```

#### Example output
```
A = 
[[50.43 50.43 50.43]
 [53.71 53.71 53.71]
 [40.18 40.18 40.18]]
|A| = 
0.0
```

#### Input
```
$ python3 04.py
```

#### Example output
```
A = 
[[2 Fraction(-1, 1) Fraction(-1, 1)]
 [Fraction(2, 1) Fraction(1, 1) Fraction(-1, 1)]
 [Fraction(7, 2) Fraction(5, 4)
  Fraction(-7505999378950827, 18014398509481984)]]
Arrangement

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

If you are interested in any of the functions, just change the parameters to those that you would like to check in the program.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

There is nothing complicated here, just download the repository from GitHub and launch the files that really interest you.
